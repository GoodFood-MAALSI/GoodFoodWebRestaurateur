# Restaurant Orders Page - Real API Integration

## âœ… Implementation Complete

Successfully integrated real API statistics into the restaurant orders page (`/restaurants/[id]/orders`) replacing the previous hardcoded values.

## ðŸ”„ What Changed

### Before
- Hardcoded order status counts calculated from local orders array
- Manual color-coded status boxes with static styling
- No business intelligence or revenue data

### After
- **Real-time Order Status**: Dynamic counts from actual orders data
- **Business Statistics**: Revenue, total orders, items sold, and average order value from API
- **Popular Menu Item**: Shows the most frequently ordered item with pricing details
- **Unified Data Source**: Single hook (`useRestaurantOrdersAndStats`) fetches both orders and stats

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. Enhanced Stats Display
- **Real-time Order Counts**: Shows current status distribution (pending, accepted, preparing, ready, delivered, cancelled)
- **Business Metrics**: Revenue, total completed orders, items sold, average order value
- **Popular Item Showcase**: Highlights the most popular menu item with order count and pricing

### 2. Improved Performance
- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Orders and stats loaded simultaneously
- **Unified State Management**: Single loading state and error handling
- **Automatic Refresh**: Stats update when order statuses change

### 3. Better UX
- **Loading Skeletons**: Prevents layout shift during data loading
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful fallbacks when stats API is unavailable
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints Used
```
GET /api/proxy/orders/{restaurantId}/stats
GET /api/proxy/orders/{restaurantId}
```

### Key Components
- `useRestaurantOrdersAndStats` - Combined hook for orders and stats
- `RestaurantStatsGrid` - Component displaying both real-time and business stats
- `StatsCard` - Reusable metric display component

### Data Flow
1. User navigates to `/restaurants/[id]/orders`
2. Hook fetches orders and stats in parallel
3. Component displays real-time order status counts
4. Component shows business statistics from API
5. Order status updates trigger automatic data refresh

## ðŸ“Š Data Structure

### Stats API Response
```typescript
{
  statusCode: 200,
  message: "Success",
  data: {
    order_count: number,
    menu_item_id: number,
    menu_item: {
      id: number,
      name: string,
      price: string,
      promotion: string
    },
    item_count: number,
    revenue: number
  }
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

1. **Accurate Data**: No more hardcoded values, everything comes from real API
2. **Business Intelligence**: Restaurant owners can see revenue, popular items, and performance metrics
3. **Real-time Updates**: Status changes reflect immediately in the statistics
4. **Better Decision Making**: Data-driven insights for restaurant management
5. **Unified Experience**: Consistent with the standalone `/stats` page design
